<p>I was playing with Stable Diffusion to make â€˜things in the shape of lettersâ€™. One thing led to another and in a couple of hours Iâ€™d generated a full alphabet of Dieter Rams-ian industrial design. So I selected a couple of hundred images and stuck them together. <a href="https://vimeo.com/745606590">Thereâ€™s a short (15s) video over on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>This is how they come out of my home PC â€˜rawâ€™. I havenâ€™t tweaked them, post-processed them, iterrated them, or used AI-upscalers or enhancers.</p>

<p>It was just a quick experiment really. To see how much you can extract the influence of a particular artist / designer / creative within a generalised data-set. And then use the model to bend the work into someting â€˜newâ€™.</p>

<p>I have all kinds of conflicting feelings about it.</p>

<p>But as a creative who has â€˜controlâ€™ itâ€™s pretty thrilling. So is spraying a flame-thrower around; until you realise what youâ€™ve done ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜¿.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s messed-up that the worldâ€™s creativity is being hoovered up, fed to a computer, having interfaces put on it, and being flogged as a subscription for $9.99. And Dieter will never see a penny. This is one of those â€˜disruptionsâ€™ that (left unchecked) is going to be very profitable for a few people and potentially disasterous for many more.</p>

<p>On the flipside â€“ my inner optmist sees amazing potential for artists and technologists to work together to create mind-blowing systems and tools and experiences. In ways that arenâ€™t trying to replace the creators, but to give them ways to extend their practice and reward them for their contributions.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s all kinds of issues to solve, but I love the idea of co-operative GANs that reward artists for their work, ideas and inspiration flowing through a neural network.</p>

<p>That may sound like sci-fi nonsense, but this stuff is getting better and better at an <em>alarming</em> rate. It would be easy to dismiss this as visual novelty, as yet another wave of Google Colabs hit Reddit, spawning thousands of hyper-realistic warrior princesses â€˜trending on Artstationâ€™. But thatâ€™s like judging the future potential of the Internet by looking at GeoCities.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pretty confident that within a couple of years youâ€™ll be able to generate images indistinguishable from stock photos. And within 3 or 4 years weâ€™ll be able to get to convincing totally believable video clips of the same quality. Which is going to have huge implications for all kinds of industries.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re someone in the creative world who likes surfing the waves of whatâ€™s coming next; itâ€™s time to start paddlingâ€¦</p>

<p>Hey Computer, give me: â€˜a bunch of dragons riding the waves like horses in that guiness advert featuring a track that sounds like Orbital featuring Brian Harveyâ€™ 30 seconds. Oh and can you make a few different versions to appeal to different audiencesâ€¦â€™.</p>
