  <li>AAIIINTT is Iain Tait sorted alphabetically.</li>
  <li>It was available.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m excited about <a href="https://food.xyz">FOOD</a> - lots of exciting stuff going on over there.</li>
  <li>But I feel the need to write more.</li>
  <li>I need an outlet for random chuff.</li>

<p>A few months ago Richard sent me this gem:</p>

<div class="image-container">
  <img src="/images/hello-world/skp.webp" alt="Shit Knowledge Philanthropist" class="image-large" />
  
    <div class="image-caption">Shit Knowledge Philanthropist</div>
  
</div>

<p>Weâ€™ve joked about it often since. But itâ€™s not entirely un-serious. Finding ways to give our knowledge and experience to others so they can get to good places quicker. Or avoid pointless stupidity. Or just reassure people that itâ€™s good to be unsure. Or to feel a bit weird about stuff.</p>

<p>And this idea of â€˜giving it all away, whether itâ€™s useful or notâ€™ has helped lift me out of the paralysis of thinking my bloggings have to be â€˜for everyoneâ€™. Instead Iâ€™m blogging for a target audience of 1 - â€˜younger meâ€™. And maybe there will be residual interest for others. Donâ€™t count on it mind.</p>

<p>Like a true Shit Knowledge Philanthropist Iâ€™m putting the site under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC-0 license</a> which means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.</p>

<p>This obviously doesnâ€™t mean if I embed the trailer to the new Marvel film you can rip that off - go and read <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">the details on the link if you want to know more</a>â€¦</p>

<p>But once this gets going if thereâ€™s anything here thatâ€™s useful, just take itâ€¦</p>

<p>And let me know if you want moreâ€¦</p>
