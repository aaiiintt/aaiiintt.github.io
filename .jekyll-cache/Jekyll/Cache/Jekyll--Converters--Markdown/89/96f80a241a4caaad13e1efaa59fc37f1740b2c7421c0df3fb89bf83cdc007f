<p>Well, short answer is: itâ€™s Iain Tait sorted alphabetically. I think it popped up during an odd coding exercise or something like that. It shows how many Aâ€™s and Iâ€™s my parents gifted me. Proportionally anyway.Itâ€™s a bit odd. And quite geeky. Slightly awkward. And itâ€™s got some AI in it. Which seemed like a good fit.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-starting-a-blog-in-2022">Why am I starting a blog in 2022?</h2>

<p>After a year of https://food.xyz operating in stealth mode itâ€™s time to â€˜come outâ€™. When Poke was new I was writing my old blog https://crackunit.com and it was really useful. It gave me a platform to talk about stuff that I was excited by, exploring, thinking, and doing. And it helped me make friends all over the place.</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t keep Crackunit going when I was at W+K and Google. Itâ€™s hard to run a really honest and authentic blog when you work for someone else. I was forever worried about something I wrote getting mis-quoted or misread and upsetting someone. Which would get me in trouble with the higher-ups. And I cope with being in trouble as well as I did when I was 5; I cry and get a loose sphincter if someone tells me off. So that meant I didnâ€™t blog much. I tried a few times, but I couldnâ€™t make back into a habit.</p>

<p>Then all the pressure of social media and all that chuff confused matters and it all became too much.</p>

<p>So this is it. A fresh start. A new platform. A new set of things to get excited aboutâ€¦</p>

<p>And Iâ€™ve built it in a way that is super lean and super distraction free (for me and for you hopefully).</p>

<p>Let me know what you thinkâ€¦</p>
