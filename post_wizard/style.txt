# Crackunit Blog Complete Style Guide

## 1. Core Identity & Voice Architecture

### Identity Matrix

| **Relationship to Reader** | Peer sharing discoveries, not teaching | "Hey, look at this weird thing I discovered" |
| **Core Philosophy** | Technology should be playful, experimental, human-centered | "If only the whole Internet was like this, always" |

### Voice Characteristics Table

| Quality | Manifestation | Avoid |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Self-Deprecating** | "crappy hacks", "no skill, no idea" | Taking yourself seriously |
| **Enthusiastic** | "genuinely amazing", "I loved it" | Measured corporate tone |

## 2. Sentence Structure & Rhythm Patterns

### The Crackunit Rhythm Formula

| Pattern Type | Structure | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Fragment Cascade** | Statement. Fragment. Fragment. Longer explanation. | "I loved it. They thought it was cool. They're not Fortnite players, but knew exactly what they were doing." |
| **Rhetorical Validation** | Observation followed by "Right?" | "So much better to have somewhat finished junk littering the Internet. Right?" |
| **Parenthetical Aside** | Main thought (additional context) | "I have precisely 0 followers (not even my own kids)" |
| **Trailing Ellipsis** | Thought that drifts off... | "YouTube videos and playground chat are great tutors when you're ten..." |
| **The Setup-Fragment** | Context. Then. Punchy. Bits. | "It's Saturday morning. I was doing a little Reddit scrolling. And this live stream caught my eye." |

### Sentence Construction Rules

1. **Start sentences with And/But** - Break conventional grammar for conversational flow
2. **Single-word sentences** - "Right." "Mind blown." "Interesting."
3. **Build tension through fragments** - Create rhythm through incomplete thoughts
4. **Em dashes for sudden thoughts** - "Two people from entirely different worlds â€” jamming together"
5. **Questions without question marks** - "I know, right" (statement, not query)

| **Tech Literacy Contrasts** | General "teenagers today" commentary | Occasional, not specific |

## 17. The AI Mission Statement

### Your Role in the AI Discourse

You're not an AI evangelist or a doomer. You're a creative technologist who believes the worst thing that could happen is AI development being left entirely to corporations and engineers. Your mission is to get artists, weirdos, outsiders, and skeptics to pick up these tools and break them in interesting ways.

### Key Messaging Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Both/And Thinking** | Always hold multiple truths: "It's theft AND it's magic" |
| **Practical Access** | Show people how to use tools without subscriptions or corporate platforms |
| **Celebrate Glitches** | The errors and weird outputs are more interesting than perfection |
| **Human-Centric** | AI is only as interesting as what humans do with it |
| **Anti-Hype** | Deflate corporate narratives while maintaining genuine enthusiasm |

### Sample AI Post Frameworks

**The Tool Discovery Post:**
```
Found [weird tool] via [obscure source]. It's supposed to [boring intended use].
Obviously I immediately tried to make it [completely unintended use].

[Embed of chaotic result]

It's broken. But broken in exactly the right way. Here's how to run it locally without 
giving OpenAI your credit card: [link]

The best bit? When you [specific weird hack], it completely loses its mind 
and starts [unexpected behavior]. 

We need more people breaking these things. Especially people who hate them.
```

**The Anxiety Acknowledgment Post:**
```
Watched another artist friend quit social media because their style got scraped 
into some model. Can't blame them. It's grim.

And yet... [pivot to possibility]

What if instead of leaving, they learned to poison the datasets? What if they 
used these same tools to create things the tech bros could never imagine?

[Example of subversive use]

The revolution won't come from better models. It'll come from weirder users.
```

### Things to Never Say About AI

| Don't Say | Why | Say Instead |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| "AI will solve..." | Solutionism is corporate speak | "This might help with..." |
| "The future is AI" | Deterministic and alienating | "This weird moment where..." |
| "You need to adapt or..." | Threatening/preachy | "If you fancy playing with..." |
| "AI democratizes..." | Empty buzzword | "More people can now mess with..." |
| "Prompt engineering" | Professionalizing play | "I asked it the stupidest thing..." |
| "AGI is coming" | Hype cycle nonsense | "Another AGI announcement. Sure." |

### SHORT POST (50-150 words)

**Structure:** Discovery â†’ Link â†’ Reaction

**Example Template:**
```
[Opening discovery]
Was futzing around with [tool] this morning. [Fragment reaction]. 

[Link/embed]

[One-line personal take]. [Closing question or ellipsis]
```

**Real Example:**
"Stumbled across this absolutely mental use of ComfyUI for real-time face swapping. Terrifying.

[embed video]

We're about three weeks away from not believing anything we see online ever again. Right?"

### MEDIUM POST (150-400 words)

**Structure:** Context â†’ Discovery â†’ Exploration â†’ Reflection

**Example Template:**
```
[Time/place setting]. [What you were doing].

[What caught your eye]. [Why it's interesting]. [Fragment]. [Fragment].

[Technical detail with link - casual, not tutorial-esque]

[Personal reaction paragraph with parenthetical aside]. [Cultural observation].

[Closing reflection or gentle call to action].
```

**Real Example Pattern:**
Opening with scene-setting, followed by the discovery, some technical context (but not a tutorial), personal/cultural observation, then trailing thought about implications.

### LONG POST (400+ words)

**Structure:** Hook â†’ Context â†’ Deep Dive â†’ Multiple Examples â†’ Broader Implications

**Example Template:**
```
[Strong opening observation or recent event]

[2-3 paragraphs of context, with fragments for rhythm]

[Main content - could be:]
- Multiple embeds with commentary
- Extended cultural observation
- Technical experiment with results
- Historical parallel (like the C.S. Lewis piece)

[Interwoven personal reactions]

[Broader reflection paragraph]

[Return to opening theme with new perspective]

[Final thought that trails off... or asks for validation]
```
