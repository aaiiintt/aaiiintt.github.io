1.  **Refined Typographic Scale:** Fine-tune line heights and margins for a more precise vertical rhythm across all elements (headings, paragraphs, lists). Ensure consistent spacing between elements.
2.  **Subtle Link Underlines:** Instead of a solid underline, consider `text-decoration-thickness` or `text-underline-offset` for a more modern, less intrusive link style. Alternatively, remove underlines entirely and rely on color/weight for distinction, with underlines only on hover.
3.  **Improved Code Block Readability:** Implement subtle syntax highlighting (using Rouge, Jekyll's default highlighter) if not already present, and consider a slightly darker background for contrast without being jarring.
4.  **Consistent Max-Width for All Content:** Ensure *all* content elements (images, tables, blockquotes, etc.) respect the `max-width: 65ch` or the overall `max-width: 832px` of the body, preventing horizontal scroll or awkward overflows.
5.  **Dedicated Mobile Navigation:** For smaller screens, implement a simple, responsive mobile navigation pattern (e.g., a stacked list or a very basic "hamburger" icon that reveals a full-width menu, ideally without JavaScript, using CSS tricks).
6.  **Post Metadata Enhancement:** Add a "reading time" estimate (Jekyll plugin or simple Liquid logic) for posts, and perhaps a subtle separator or layout for better visual parsing of metadata.
7.  **Minimalist Pagination:** Implement simple "Previous Post" / "Next Post" navigation at the bottom of individual posts, and clear pagination for the blog listing page, adhering to the minimalist aesthetic.
8.  **Favicon and Apple Touch Icon Optimization:** Ensure the favicon is a simple, high-contrast monochrome icon that reflects the minimalist brand, and that Apple Touch Icons are correctly sized and optimized for various devices.
9.  **Semantic HTML for Layout:** Review the entire HTML structure to ensure maximum semantic correctness, using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>` appropriately.
10. **Structured Data for SEO:** Implement basic structured data (JSON-LD) for blog posts (e.g., `Article` schema) within `_layouts/post.html` to improve SEO and how content appears in search results.
