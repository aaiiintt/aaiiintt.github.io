take this document and rethink it slightly the point is not about making a service for a sector, it's about being able to build exactly the AI powered software that you want for you - like I build a fun habit tracker for my kids which is setup just for the things they want - no ads, no subscriptions, no faff. And it works great. ---category: technologydate: '2025-09-01'layout: posttitle: Wow that's amazing. You've just been eaten.---The big AI companies aren't just winning - they're systematically absorbing entire categories of AI startups faster than you can say "series A funding." I've watched this pattern play out dozens of times now, and it's properly fascinating how predictable it's become.{% include image.html src="/images/2025-09-01-your-favorite-ai-startup-already-dead-mate/visual-showing-timeline-of-major-tech-companies-acquiring-or-crushing-ai-startups.webp" alt="Visual showing timeline of major tech companies acquiring or crushing AI startups" %}## The Infinite Absorption MachineHere's what keeps happening: Some clever startup creates a specialized AI tool - let's say it's for converting text to speech, or generating images, or whatever's trendy this week. They build something genuinely impressive, get some traction, maybe even raise a decent chunk of change. Then boom - OpenAI or Anthropic or Google casually drops the same feature into their foundational models, usually better implemented, and suddenly that startup's entire reason for existing evaporates.We celebrate these plucky AI startups as if they're not building their houses on foundations of sand. But the reality is brutally simple: the companies with the massive language models can basically eat any "AI layer" they fancy.## Why Scale Wins (Every Single Time)The advantage these giants have is proper massive:1. **Data Centers & Computing Power**: While startups struggle to rent GPU time, the big players are building their own specialized chips.2. **Training Data**: They've got access to unfathomable amounts of it, and they're gathering more every second.3. **Talent Gravity**: The best AI researchers tend to orbit around where the most interesting problems (and biggest computers) live.{% include image.html src="/images/2025-09-01-your-favorite-ai-startup-already-dead-mate/infographic-comparing-resources-between-major-ai-companies-and-startups.webp" alt="Infographic comparing resources between major AI companies and startups" %}## The Brutal Economics of It AllIt's like trying to run a profitable restaurant inside someone else's restaurant, using their kitchen, while paying them rent. And then being surprised when they decide to add your signature dish to their menu.## Examples From The AI GraveyardLet's look at some recent casualties:- **Voice AI startups**: Remember when this was a hot category? Then OpenAI dropped their text-to-speech API. Now Google has live auto translation.- **Image generation specialists**: Even Adobe Firefly has added Nano Banana to it's image generation options (AS THE DEFAULT)- **Code completion tools**: GitHub Copilot (powered by OpenAI) basically owns this space now.{% include image.html src="/images/2025-09-01-your-favorite-ai-startup-already-dead-mate/timeline-showing-defunct-ai-startups-and-the-big-tech-features-that-replaced-them.webp" alt="Timeline showing defunct AI startups and the big tech features that replaced them" %}## What This Means For BuildersIf you're building in the AI space (and who isn't these days?), here's what to keep in mind:1. **Build on uniqueness**: Your competitive advantage can't just be "we do X with AI." The giants will copy that in a heartbeat.2. **Focus on specific industries**: Deep deep domain expertise in healthcare or finance might save you.3. **Embrace integration**: Instead of competing, build tools that make the big models more useful in specific contexts.## The Way ForwardThe future probably isn't in building yet another AI layer - it's in finding creative ways to use these foundational models that the giants haven't thought of yet. It's about being clever with implementation rather than trying to compete on core technology.Think of it like this: We're not in the era of building new social networks anymore - we're in the era of building brilliant things on top of existing platforms. The same principle applies to AI.The winners won't be the ones trying to out-compute OpenAI or Google. They'll be the ones who figure out how to use these powerful tools in ways that actually solve specific problems for specific people. And that's something even a proper massive language model can't do on its own.
