1.  **Refined Typographic Scale:** Fine-tune line heights and margins for a more precise vertical rhythm across all elements (headings, paragraphs, lists). Ensure consistent spacing between elements.
2.  **Subtle Link Underlines:** Instead of a solid underline, consider `text-decoration-thickness` or `text-underline-offset` for a more modern, less intrusive link style. Alternatively, remove underlines entirely and rely on color/weight for distinction, with underlines only on hover.
4.  **Consistent Max-Width for All Content:** Ensure *all* content elements (images, tables, blockquotes, etc.) respect the `max-width: 65ch` or the overall `max-width: 832px` of the body, preventing horizontal scroll or awkward overflows.
9.  **Semantic HTML for Layout:** Review the entire HTML structure to ensure maximum semantic correctness, using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>` appropriately.
10. **Structured Data for SEO:** Implement basic structured data (JSON-LD) for blog posts (e.g., `Article` schema) within `_layouts/post.html` to improve SEO and how content appears in search results.
