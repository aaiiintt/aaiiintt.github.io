    <p>Let’s get the scary part out of the way. I don’t normally make predicitions. But I can feel something heavily in my waters: we’re about to experience the greatest <strong>“collapse”</strong> in creative value since… well, ever? And I know that sounds like hyperbolic nonsense. But stick with me.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, if you wanted:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A funny illustration of a raspberry with legs</li>
  <li>30s of smooth jazz</li>
  <li>A 3d model of a persimmon</li>
  <li>An article</li>
  <li>A video</li>
  <li>Code</li>
</ul>

<p>You had to either:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Learn the skills (takes ages)</li>
  <li>Pay someone who had (£££)</li>
  <li>Accept something substandard</li>
</ol>

<p>Now? Well…</p>

<p>I think we all know how a blursed gif of Will Smith eating spaghetti has become <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/will-smith-ai-tour-video-artificial-intelligence-1236357541/">Will Smith not actually using AI to create fans in his HD video</a> in a couple of years.</p>

<div class="image-container">

</div>

<p>I don’t think it’s hard to believe that at some point soon anyone will be able to make a decent version of anything. Unless something completly blows up.</p>

<p>So, when digital anything content / knowledge / software / etc can be made instantly and infinitely we have to start asking awkward questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do humans actually value?</li>
  <li>What makes something meaningful?</li>
  <li>Why did we care about “creative work” in the first place?</li>
</ul>

<p>The things I still care about in “creative work” are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A friend taking time to help with a problem</li>
  <li>Someone understanding exactly what I mean and making it better</li>
  <li>People coming together to make something TOGETHER</li>
  <li>The satisfaction of fixing something or making something new</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m aware that some of that can and will be done by AI. But these are a few of my favourite things that I’m trying to protect as we become ‘more AI’.</p>

<p>I know it’s a lazy comparison but when photography arrived everyone lost their minds. “Painting is dead!”, “Who’ll ever commission a portrait again?”</p>

<p>But painting didn’t die. It evolved. It got weird. It got abstract. It started doing things cameras couldn’t. Because the value wasn’t in the precise reproduction of reality - it was in the human interpretation, the meaning, the mess.</p>

<p>And now we’re here again. But the scale and speed make it hard to know what to do, so lots of us are just looking the other way and hoping it won’t happen.</p>

<p>Right. So what’s the actual point here? A few things:</p>

<p><strong>Stop Competing with AI</strong>
It’s pointless. It’s like competing with a calculator at arithmetic. Instead, start doing things AI can’t. Be weird. Be human. Be challenging.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on Meaning, Not Output</strong>
The value isn’t in the thing you make. It’s in why you made it, who it’s for, who you made it with, and what it means.</p>

<p><strong>Build Communities</strong>
AI can make content. It can’t create connections. It can’t build communities.</p>

<p><strong>Document the Human Bits</strong>
Share your process. Your mistakes. Your weird decisions. That’s the stuff AI can’t replicate.</p>

<p>We’re in for a proper weird time. Things that used to be valuable won’t be. Things we never valued much might become precious. It’s going to be messy and uncomfortable and probably a bit scary.</p>

<p>But also…exciting?</p>

<p>Because maybe - just maybe - this forces us to focus on the actually important bits of being human. The messy bits. The connection bits. The meaning bits.</p>

<p>And at risk of stating the obvious. It’s not about what the tools can make. It’s about the meaning people like us can make with the tools. Or something like that…</p>
