<p>I was playing with Stable Diffusion to make ‘things in the shape of letters’. One thing led to another and in a couple of hours I’d generated a full alphabet of Dieter Rams-ian industrial design. So I selected a couple of hundred images and stuck them together. <a href="https://vimeo.com/745606590">There’s a short (15s) video over on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>This is how they come out of my home PC ‘raw’. I haven’t tweaked them, post-processed them, iterrated them, or used AI-upscalers or enhancers.</p>

<p>It was just a quick experiment really. To see how much you can extract the influence of a particular artist / designer / creative within a generalised data-set. And then use the model to bend the work into someting ‘new’.</p>

<p>I have all kinds of conflicting feelings about it.</p>

<p>But as a creative who has ‘control’ it’s pretty thrilling. So is spraying a flame-thrower around; until you realise what you’ve done 🔥😿.</p>

<p>It’s messed-up that the world’s creativity is being hoovered up, fed to a computer, having interfaces put on it, and being flogged as a subscription for $9.99. And Dieter will never see a penny. This is one of those ‘disruptions’ that (left unchecked) is going to be very profitable for a few people and potentially disasterous for many more.</p>

<p>On the flipside – my inner optmist sees amazing potential for artists and technologists to work together to create mind-blowing systems and tools and experiences. In ways that aren’t trying to replace the creators, but to give them ways to extend their practice and reward them for their contributions.</p>

<p>There’s all kinds of issues to solve, but I love the idea of co-operative GANs that reward artists for their work, ideas and inspiration flowing through a neural network.</p>

<p>That may sound like sci-fi nonsense, but this stuff is getting better and better at an <em>alarming</em> rate. It would be easy to dismiss this as visual novelty, as yet another wave of Google Colabs hit Reddit, spawning thousands of hyper-realistic warrior princesses ‘trending on Artstation’. But that’s like judging the future potential of the Internet by looking at GeoCities.</p>

<p>I’m pretty confident that within a couple of years you’ll be able to generate images indistinguishable from stock photos. And within 3 or 4 years we’ll be able to get to convincing totally believable video clips of the same quality. Which is going to have huge implications for all kinds of industries.</p>

<p>If you’re someone in the creative world who likes surfing the waves of what’s coming next; it’s time to start paddling…</p>

<p>Hey Computer, give me: ‘a bunch of dragons riding the waves like horses in that guiness advert featuring a track that sounds like Orbital featuring Brian Harvey’ 30 seconds. Oh and can you make a few different versions to appeal to different audiences…’.</p>
