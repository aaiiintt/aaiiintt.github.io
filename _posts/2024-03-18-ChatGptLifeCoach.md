I found this in a folder. It’s some advice from ChatGPT. Which I think I might have augmented at some point. It’s pretty good. I should try some of this...

1. **Embrace Your Unique Strengths:** Creative range, an instinctive feel for technology, innovative thinking at a systemic level, clarity, calm, and an ability to hyperfocus. Identify tasks that align with these strengths and allocate dedicated time for creative work.
2. **Recognise Your Unique Challenges:** Sustained focus without new inputs and challenges, inconsistent attention to detail (sometimes acute, sometimes absent), issues with administrative tasks, and risk of inconsistent follow through without support.
3. **Recognise Your Points of Difference:** you see things in a unique way. That includes everything from, talent, ideas and systems. Sometimes this can be too much. And you need to focus on the best use of you at that moment.
4. **Foster Collaboration:** Delegate tasks that don't require your specific expertise, allowing you to focus on strategic and creative aspects. Emphasize the value of diverse perspectives and ideas.
5. **Prioritize and Stay Organized:** Develop effective strategies for prioritizing tasks and managing time. Break down projects into manageable steps, use organizational tools like to-do lists or project management software, and demand clear timelines to stay focused and productive.
6. **Enhance Communication Channels:** Establish open and clear lines of communication within your team. Ensure expectations, goals, and project details are well-communicated, and regularly check in with team members to provide guidance and address questions. Have simple, singular platforms and stick to them. Too many ways to communicate and chaotic storage may be issues for you.
7. **Embrace Flexibility:** Consider flexible work arrangements that accommodate different work styles and preferences. This may include flexible hours, remote work options, or other arrangements that support a healthy work-life balance and optimize productivity. Sprints and fallow periods maybe?
8. **Effective Time Management:** Explore different time management techniques to enhance productivity. Experiment with strategies such as setting specific work intervals, using timers, or establishing structured routines to improve focus and efficiency.
9. **Prioritize Self-Care and Stress Management:** Place importance on self-care practices to manage stress and overall well-being. Engage in regular exercise, practice mindfulness or meditation, and ensure you get sufficient restful sleep. Taking care of your physical and mental health is essential for success.
10. **Seek Support and Guidance:** Consider working with a coach or mentor who can provide support, guidance, and accountability. They can help you navigate challenges, set goals, and provide valuable insights tailored to your unique situation.
