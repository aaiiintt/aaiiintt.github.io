I’ve just set up the blog with an Apple Shortcut so I can just hit a ‘new blog post button’, and it fires up IA Writer with all of the ‘Front Matter’ taken care of in Jekyll.

All I have to do is commit the changes in Git and we’re live. It’s splendid.

But only a certain kind of weirdo will understand the extreme satisfaction I feel right now.
