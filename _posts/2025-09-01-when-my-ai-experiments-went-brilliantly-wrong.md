title: You're thinking about AI all wrong
---

We all are. We're all thinking about AI all wrong. Not just a bit wrong - fundamentally missing the point. While everyone's obsessed with getting ChatGPT to write their emails or Midjourney to generate their logo concepts, they're overlooking something remarkable: we've basically got a creative collaborator with access to the entire scope of human knowledge and culture.

## Beyond the Digital Butler

The current AI discourse feels stuck in this "helpful assistant" paradigm - like we've been given the keys to a massive creative studio but we're only using it to organize the supply cupboard. Don't get me wrong, I love a well-organized cupboard, but there's so much more potential here.

I've been experimenting with some rather unorthodox approaches (read: somewhat questionable hacks) using various AI models, treating them less like tools and more like creative collaborators. The results have been... interesting.

## What If We Just...?

Here's a concrete example: Instead of asking Claude to help write a story, I've been feeding it fragments of ancient myths, modern pop lyrics, and scientific papers about quantum mechanics - then asking it to find the connecting threads and weave something new. The outputs are genuinely fascinating, often spotting patterns that would take humans years of research to uncover.

## The Unexpected Connections

When you give an AI system this kind of creative freedom, it starts making these brilliant lateral connections. It's like having a research assistant who's simultaneously an expert in Renaissance art, molecular biology, and K-pop, and can spot the hidden parallels between them.

Some recent experiments:
- Combining medieval illuminated manuscripts with circuit board designs
- Mixing cooking recipes with architectural principles
- Blending weather patterns with classical music structures

## Looking Forward

The real potential isn't in getting AI to do our existing tasks more efficiently - it's in discovering entirely new forms of creative expression that we haven't even imagined yet. It's about using these systems to explore the spaces between our traditional categories of knowledge and creativity.

## Practical Takeaways

1. Stop thinking about AI as just a task-completion tool
2. Experiment with cross-disciplinary inputs
3. Look for unexpected connections between different domains
4. Give the AI room to surprise you with novel combinations
5. Focus on exploration rather than specific outputs

The next time you're working with AI, try asking yourself: "What if instead of solving a problem, we explored something entirely new?" The results might surprise you. After all, we've got the sum of human knowledge to play with - seems a shame to just use it for writing emails, doesn't it?
